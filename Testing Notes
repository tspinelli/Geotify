Testing Notes

• 1st test
  ○ No sig change usage
  ○ Started location manager with Best for navigation setting
  ○ Sending a network packet every 30 seconds
  ○ Result
    § Obviously my battery was noticeably draining
    § It received network results for 3 hours before I stopped it
• 2nd test
  ○ Added a sig change notification start before I start location manager
  ○ Location manager set to a fixed value of 3KM
  ○ Sending a network packet every 5 minutes
  ○ Result
    § Ran for 5 hours just fine
• 3rd test
  ○ Turn the location manager on and off with regions
    § I can only send data IF I have the location manager started, even if that means low precision mode
  ○ Networking DOES resume if I have turned the location manager off and then back on in the background
• 4th test - added motion manager
  ○ Same behavior as the 3rd test
  ○ Data only sent when the location manager was running - regardless of motion manager
    • Need to talk with Ibrahim - I think the background task handler is what's allowing the apps to run for some period of time and then stop
  ○ I only seem to get network calls to complete when the location manager is running - regardless of high/low precision
• Notes
  ○ Background fetch is not a viable option for our work
  ○ Location manager precision can be modified on change of georegion
